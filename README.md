# LLNL hires-timers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalability-llnl/llnl-hires-timers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/scalability-llnl/llnl-hires-timers)

This is the llnl-hires-timers library, a library to support platform-specific
high-resolution timers by a platform-independent c function-call: ``get_time_ns()``.

At compile time the best available timer at your platform will be selected and
the platform-specific call to get the best timer will be used to return the
timer value in nanoseconds.



## Building

To build, you need to use cmake. We recommend that you build out of source. That
is, you should make a directory to build in first.

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```



## Usage

You can use llnl-hires-timers by including `hires-timers.h` and calling the following
function:
```C
timing_t get_time_ns();
```

`timing_t` is defined as:
```C
typedef unsigned long long timing_t;
```

At compile-time you should link (static or dynamic) against libhires-timers with
`-lhires-timers`.
